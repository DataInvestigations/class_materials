## Goals for today

- Work in R

- Explore data for group projects

- Use the tidyverse to manipulate data

## Explore the tidyverse

Using le4_data_manipulation.R as a template...

1.  Read your data for the class project into R.

2.  Examine your data for mistakes.

3.  Experiment with “group by” in dplyr to do some calculation.

4.  Use mutate and summarise on your data. How are these different? Annotate your code.

5. Advanced users: Explore the pivot commands, changing data from wider to longer or vice versa

*Next week*:  Commit and push to GitHub as part of your individual assignment for week 4
